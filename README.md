Database Configuration: It is configured to connect to a MySQL database named bad_links_database using pymysql as the DBAPI. The connection details such as username, password, and host are provided in the db_url.
Table Definition: It defines a table structure for storing "bad links" with columns for id, url, status, and scan_date. The url column is unique, ensuring no duplicate URLs are stored.
Functionality:
store_bad_link(url, status='bad'): A function to insert a new bad link into the database if it doesn't already exist. It prints a message indicating whether the link was stored or if it already exists in the database.
check_url_in_database(url): A function to check if a URL is present in the database and return its status. If the URL is not found, it returns None.
Now, I'll proceed with reviewing the content of AI.py to further understand the components of your project. ​​
The AI.py file is a Python script that integrates machine learning components and external API calls for URL safety prediction and analysis. Here's a breakdown of its core functionalities:

Component Loading: The load_components() function loads various machine learning model components stored as .pkl files, including a logistic regression model, label encoder, vectorizer, and scaler, which are essential for processing and predicting the safety of URLs.
URL Safety Prediction: The predict_url_safety() function takes a URL as input and uses the loaded machine learning components to predict whether the URL is safe or potentially harmful. It vectorizes the URL, scales the vectorized form, and then uses the logistic model to make a prediction, which is then decoded by the label encoder to a human-readable label.
URLScan.io Integration: The submit_to_urlscan_and_fetch_result() function submits a given URL to URLScan.io, a service that scans and analyzes websites for safety and security issues, and fetches the scan result. If the URLScan.io analysis deems a URL as malicious based on a score or tags, it returns "bad"; otherwise, "good".
URL Checking and Scanning Process: The check_and_scan_url() function orchestrates the overall process. It first checks if the URL is already marked as "bad" in the database. If not, it uses the AI model to predict the URL's safety. Depending on the prediction, it may further submit the URL to URLScan.io for a detailed analysis. Based on the outcomes, it updates the database with the URL's status and prints relevant messages.
Next, I'll examine the AI_model.py file to further enrich the README content. ​​
The AI_model.py file is a Python script focused on creating, training, and evaluating a machine learning model for phishing site detection based on URL analysis. Here's a detailed breakdown of its key components and functionalities:

Data Loading and Preprocessing:
Loads a dataset from a CSV file named phishing_site_urls.csv, which presumably contains URLs and their corresponding labels (safe or phishing).
Separates the dataset into features (URLs) and labels.
Encodes the categorical labels into a numerical format using LabelEncoder.
Model Pipeline Creation:
Constructs a Pipeline consisting of a CountVectorizer for converting URLs to a token count matrix, a StandardScaler for scaling the vectorized data, and a LogisticRegression model for classification. This pipeline ensures a streamlined process from raw data to predictions.
Model Training and Evaluation:
Splits the data into training and testing sets to evaluate the model's performance.
Trains the model pipeline on the training data.
Evaluates the model on both the training and testing sets, reporting accuracy, confusion matrix, and a classification report for a detailed performance analysis.
Cross-Validation:
Performs 5-fold cross-validation on the entire dataset to assess the model's generalizability and prints the mean cross-validation accuracy.
Model Persistence:
Saves the trained model pipeline and the label encoder to .pkl files for later use in predictions or further analysis.
